Python has become the language of choice of many developers for building all kinds of applications across a wide range of industries, but to fully take advantage of its power and flexibility, you need to master all its advanced functionality. Python is a flexible, customizable language that provides features that other languages support only through third-party libraries or require that you build yourself. In this course, Joe Marini takes you through some of the more advanced features of the Python language. Joe shows you how to write code that is easier to read and maintain, build classes that work just like the ones that are native to the language, and work with some of the newest features of the language itself, like structural pattern matching.
If you're ready to take your Python skills to the next level, join Joe in this course.
