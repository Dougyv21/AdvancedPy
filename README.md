# Advanced Python: Language Features

This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `course-name`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

Python has quickly become one of the go-to programming languages for developers across a wide range of industries and application types, from automation to data science, to building complex back-end infrastructure. The Python language is flexible, customizable, and provides right out of the box the kinds of features that other languages make you go to third party libraries for, or require that you build yourself.

In this course, veteran developer Joe Marini shows some of the more advanced features of the Python language. Joe demonstrates how to write code that is easier to read and maintain, build classes that work just like the ones that are native to the language, and work with some of the newest features of the language itself like structural pattern matching.

## Instructor
Joe Marini has been building software professionally for some of the biggest and best known companies in Silicon Valley for more than 30 years.
